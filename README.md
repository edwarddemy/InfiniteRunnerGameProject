# Infinite Runner

## Introduction
This is my first project using the Unity Engine. It was a stepping point into getting familiar with the engine and being able to create my first gameplay loop.

## Overview
An infinite runner is where the player has to continue a course for as long as they can for a score. I tried to recreate a similar experience by applying the same mechanics any other infinite runner would have.

## Custom Features

Applied Game Features and Mechanics:

- Procedural generation of levels
- Full gameplay loop, where the player may lose by falling and being able to restart
